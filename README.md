# Producer Consumer Problem Sample

This is a implementation of Producer-Consumer Problem made by C++ and Winapi.

The code use ring buffer to implement the buffer, use the Semaphore and Mutex to solve the race condition.

There are lot of example on Linux but seldom exist example on Windows, so I write an implementation on Windows.
